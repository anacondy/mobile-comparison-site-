# Security Best Practices - Mobile Comparison Site

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Mobile Comparison Site to ensure safe public deployment on GitHub Pages.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- **Implementation**: Set via meta tag in `index.html`
- **Purpose**: Prevents XSS attacks by controlling which resources can be loaded
- **Policy Details**:
  - `default-src 'self'`: Only load resources from same origin by default
  - `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`: Allow scripts from same origin and inline scripts
  - `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`: Allow styles from same origin and inline styles
  - `img-src 'self' data: https:`: Allow images from same origin, data URIs, and HTTPS
  - `connect-src 'self' https://en.wikipedia.org`: Only allow API calls to self and Wikipedia

### 2. XSS Prevention
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized using `sanitizeHTML()` function
- **DOM Manipulation**: Using `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` where possible
- **API Response Handling**: Parse and validate all data from external APIs

### 3. HTTPS Enforcement
- GitHub Pages automatically serves over HTTPS
- All external API calls use HTTPS (Wikipedia API)
- No mixed content warnings

### 4. No Sensitive Data Exposure
- No API keys or secrets stored in code
- No personal data collection or storage
- No cookies or local storage used

### 5. CORS Policy
- Wikipedia API requests use `origin: '*'` parameter for proper CORS handling
- No credentials sent with cross-origin requests

### 6. Dependency Security
- **Zero external dependencies**: No npm packages or third-party libraries
- No supply chain attack vulnerabilities
- Pure vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

### 7. Safe API Integration
- Read-only access to Wikipedia API
- No write operations
- Error handling prevents information leakage
- Request timeout handling

### 8. Input Validation
- Query length validation (minimum 2 characters)
- Debouncing to prevent API abuse
- Result limiting (max 6 suggestions)

## Security Testing Checklist

- [x] XSS attacks prevented through input sanitization
- [x] CSRF not applicable (no server-side state)
- [x] SQL injection not applicable (no database)
- [x] No sensitive data in client code
- [x] HTTPS enforced by GitHub Pages
- [x] CSP headers configured
- [x] No external dependencies to audit
- [x] Error messages don't leak system information

## Enhanced Security Measures (2025)

### Recently Implemented:
1. ✅ **Referrer Policy**: `no-referrer` policy added to protect user privacy
2. ✅ **Permissions Policy**: Restricts unused browser features (camera, microphone, geolocation)
3. ✅ **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing attacks
4. ✅ **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking by blocking iframe embedding
5. ✅ **Strict Transport Security**: Forces HTTPS connections (via GitHub Pages)

### Additional Security Layers:
- **Input Length Validation**: Maximum query length enforced
- **JSON Schema Validation**: API responses validated against expected structure
- **Timeout Protection**: API calls have reasonable timeouts to prevent hanging
- **Error Boundary**: Graceful error handling without information leakage

## Potential Future Improvements

### Future Security Enhancements:
1. **Subresource Integrity (SRI)**: If CDN resources are added in the future
2. **Content Security Policy Level 3**: Upgrade to CSP3 with stricter nonce-based policies
3. **Certificate Transparency**: Monitor SSL certificate issuance
4. **Security.txt**: Add /.well-known/security.txt for vulnerability disclosure

## Security Contact

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:
1. Do not open a public issue
2. Contact the repository owner directly
3. Provide details about the vulnerability

## License
MIT License - See LICENSE file for details

## Compliance

### OWASP Top 10 Coverage:
1. ✅ Injection: Not applicable (no backend)
2. ✅ Broken Authentication: Not applicable (no auth)
3. ✅ Sensitive Data Exposure: No sensitive data
4. ✅ XML External Entities (XXE): Not applicable
5. ✅ Broken Access Control: Not applicable (public data only)
6. ✅ Security Misconfiguration: CSP properly configured
7. ✅ XSS: Prevented through sanitization
8. ✅ Insecure Deserialization: JSON parsing with error handling
9. ✅ Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities: Zero dependencies
10. ✅ Insufficient Logging & Monitoring: Console logging for debugging

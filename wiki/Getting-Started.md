# Getting Started

Welcome! This guide will help you get up and running with the Mobile Comparison Site.

## üìã Prerequisites

To use the Mobile Comparison Site, you need:
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Internet connection (for fetching phone data from Wikipedia)
- JavaScript enabled in your browser

## üåê Using the Live Site

The easiest way to use the application is to visit the live site:

**[https://anacondy.github.io/mobile-comparison-site-/](https://anacondy.github.io/mobile-comparison-site-/)**

No installation required!

## üíª Running Locally

If you want to run the site locally:

### Option 1: Direct File Access
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anacondy/mobile-comparison-site-.git
   cd mobile-comparison-site-
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Simply double-click the file, or
   - Right-click and select "Open with" your browser

### Option 2: Using a Local Server (Recommended)

Using a local server ensures proper CORS handling and mimics production environment.

#### Using Python
```bash
# Python 3.x
python -m http.server 8000

# Python 2.x (if you still have it)
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

#### Using Node.js
```bash
# If you have npx installed
npx http-server

# Or install globally
npm install -g http-server
http-server
```

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

4. **Compare**: Once both phones are loaded, the comparison table appears automatically
